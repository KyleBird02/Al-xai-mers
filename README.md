# Al-xai-mers

Al-xai-mers is a system designed for doctors and patients to facilitate the upload and analysis of brain MRI scans for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. Utilizing the CIDR ratings scale, the system provides a grading for Alzheimer's disease severity based on the uploaded MRI scans. Additionally, Al-xai-mers implements LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to explain the predictions made by the model, aiding in understanding and validation of the diagnosis.

This system can be particularly useful for obtaining second opinions, aiding in treatment decisions, and enhancing communication between medical professionals and patients.

## Features
